## Overview

Learn about new baseball statistics, explore relationships between certain statistics and team success, and construct your own teams with the MLB Team Builder App.

This investigation sought to answer four main questions.

1. Which baseball statistics are important in predicting overall team success? We measure team success as the sum of each player's WAR or WPA.

2. Similarly, which baseball statistics contribute to fantasy team success, measured in Total Fantasy Points?

3. Based on findings from the first two research questions, does there seem to be similar importance of a statistic regardless of if we are interested in real life or fantasy baseball?

4. Lastly, how does variable importance (in regards to predicting and accumulating WAR) change based on position?
