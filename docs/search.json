    "text": "Survival analysis is a branch of statistics practiced in medical fields, engineering, and economics. Though less common, survival analysis can also be utilized in sports through the investigation of career length. Regardless of the sport, coaches and front offices want to know how long a player will be a successful professional before they draft, sign, or trade for them. Some sports, such as baseball, have implemented statistics into decision-making more than others.\nIn this study, we wanted to investigate and predict the career length of Major League pitchers. Specifically, we looked to explore relationships between velocity, spin rates, handedness, pitch usage, and draft status in order to discover what impacts career length. To quantify career length, measured in total innings pitched in the Major Leagues, our initiating event was defined as the date of a pitcher’s MLB debut and the terminating event was defined as the end of their Major League career.\nCheck out my in-depth analysis here!"

    "text": "This research is predicated on determining the odds that a pass is completed in the NFL, based on data from the 2022 season.\nThere are a multitude of variables within the game of football that have an impact on whether a pass is completed, many of which we attempt to capture in our modeling. However, we cannot account for the baseline talent and decision making ability of each individual quarterback in our dataset by simply using a logistic regression model. In the same way, the talent of the surrounding teammates, especially the lineman and wide receivers, understandably has an impact on the odds of completion.\nWith a logistic model, the assumption would be that because we are observing the highest level of football, each quarterback and his teammates must be equally talented to play professionally, and therefore the odds of completing a pass are solely based on the football-specific contexts we include as predictor variables. We believe this is an over-generalization. In fact, the baseline talent and decision making ability of each individual quarterback can and should be thought of as correlated with the odds of completing a pass.\nBecause of this, as well as the fact that our data contains repeated measurement of the same quarterback (passes thrown throughout a season), the following investigation is from a “Correlated Data” framework and utilizes Longitudinal Data techniques.\nCheck out the full analysis here!"
